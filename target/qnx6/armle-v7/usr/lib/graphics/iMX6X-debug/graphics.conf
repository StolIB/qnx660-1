   # NOTE 1:  it is possible to connect the same WFD port to multiple display
   # outputs IF and ONLY IF the displays have compatible timing and format.
   # HDMI is 24 bit RGB888.
   # LVDS is either 24 bit RGB888 or 18 bit sparse RGB666.
   # The Okaya 7" display panel for the SabreLite is 18 bit packed RGB666,
   # and has small delays on its clock edges.
   # Connecting multiple incompatible displays to the same WFD port is
   # NOT SUPPORTED and WILL NOT WORK.
   # The driver does not check these constraints.

   # NOTE 2:  if a WFD port is connected to LVDS, then the clock for that
   # port will be derived from the LDB clock source instead of the IPU HSP clock,
   # regardless of what other display types are connected to the port.
   # This may result in small clock frequency changes (or large ones if the
   # BSP has configured the LDB clock source to a fixed frequency).

   # NOTE 3:  All available WFD ports are always enabled, whether
   # there is a display output assigned to them or not.  There is no
   # interaction with hardware associated with unused WFD ports.

   # NOTE 4:  For compatibility with legacy config files, "display-type = xxx"
   # is exactly equivalent to "wfd-port-xxx = 1"; however, if any wfd-port
   # option is used, display-type is ignored.

   # NOTE 5:  The semantics of ipu-index have expanded.
   # ipu-index = 2 swaps the IPU positions in the WFD port mappings
   # described above, so IPU2 will be used instead of IPU1 and vice versa.
   # All other values of ipu-index, including the missing value, have no effect.
   # IPUs will be used if and only if the corresponding WFD port in the table
   # above is mapped to an output.

   # NOTE 6:  For compatibility with legacy config files, if no options are
   # specified, "display-type = lvds1" (which is equivalent to
   # "wfd-port-lvds1 = 1") is assumed.  At least one active WFD port is
   # always required.

   # NOTE 7:  Outputs are only configured if there is a WFD port assigned
   # to them.  Unconfigured output hardware is not disturbed.  In particular,
   # u-boot may enable outputs beyond those listed in graphics.conf, and
   # these outputs may remain active.

   # NOTE 8:  Ports 3 and 4 (and pipelines 5 and 6) are not yet implemented.

# If you need IPU1 for capture, you can move WFD port 1 to IPU2 instead.
# This option is ignored on DualLite and Solo because they have no IPU2.
